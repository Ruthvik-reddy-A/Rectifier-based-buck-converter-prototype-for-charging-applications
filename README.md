In the present-day scenario, we use a lot of chargers and electrical storage devices, as the world is moving more towards electrical side, we need highly efficient power converters and storage devices.

The importance of using diode rectifier buck converter is:  High Efficiency, Compact Size, Low Cost, Wide Input Voltage.

Diode rectifier based buck converter is a type of DC-DC converter that uses a diode rectifier and a buck converter to efficiently step down a higher input voltage to a lower output voltage.
